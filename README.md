## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

* Array creation and manipulation (`ndarray`)
* Indexing and slicing (1D & 2D arrays)
* Vectorized mathematical operations
* Boolean masking and filtering
* Reshaping and dimension handling
* Aggregation functions (`mean`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `std`)
* Random number generation

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The objective of this repository is to strengthen core numerical computing skills that support:

* Data cleaning and transformation
* Efficient data processing
* Analytical computations
* Preparation for Data Analyst roles

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python
* NumPy
* Jupyter Notebook
